SlyPanel
========

SlyPanel is an app for Android (4.1+) that takes information from Linux computers/servers and serves as a "Status monitor".

At the moment, external libraries are as follows:

 - JSch (For the SSH backend)
 - HelloCharts (For Graphing the output for CPU usage etc.)
 - AndroidPlot (For the graphs)

Server requirements:

 - Debian based OS (Commands were tested on Ubuntu 14.10)
 - SSH server enabled and port forwarded (If required)
 - Root access to the server (To be comfirmed)
